Not just for morale,

507

but so the Japanese know
what it feels like to be hit.

508

I'm sending Halsey to attack
the Marshall Islands.

what we're facing,

the enemy carrier?

Then we go in and clean up
the remaining targets.

What happens
if we get shot down?

534

end up as a POW.

814
00:58:37,238 --> 00:58:39,470
(IN ENGLISH) So, I just got
off the phone with Washington,

815
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:41,136
and their intelligence guys

816
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:43,637
think you're wrong
about this big operation.

817
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:45,637
They think that the Japs
are sending their carriers

818
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:47,036
back into the Coral Sea.

819
00:58:47,038 --> 00:58:49,670
Yeah, and they've ordered me
to keep <i>Enterprise</i> down there.

820
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:50,637
That's a mistake.

821
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:53,203
Washington is starting
from a faulty assumption

822
00:58:53,205 --> 00:58:55,637
and looking for evidence
to corroborate it.

823
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:57,572
So, what's
the Japs' real target?

824
00:58:58,138 --> 00:59:00,003
We believe it's Midway.

825
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:02,036
They see our base there
as a step towards Hawaii

826
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,572
and eventually the West Coast.

827
00:59:04,672 --> 00:59:06,003
When?

828
00:59:06,005 --> 00:59:07,138
In a few weeks.

829
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:11,136
I think it's time
to pay a visit

830
00:59:11,138 --> 00:59:12,637

Rochefort's way of doing
things is especially...

835
00:59:30,473 --> 00:59:31,704
particular.

842
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:49,037
If you'll follow me, sir.

843
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:50,304
Didn't realize that the Navy

844
00:59:50,306 --> 00:59:52,704
had so many
trained codebreakers.

845

We don't.

846
00:59:53,907 --> 00:59:56,604
Most of these men were
in the band on the <i>California.</i>

847
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:59,638
But since we don't have
much use for bands these days,

848
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,404
Rochefort thought that
their musical abilities

849
01:00:01,406 --> 01:00:02,504
might make them naturals

Well,
Lieutenant Commander Layton

856
01:00:29,107 --> 01:00:31,405
has been known to exaggerate.

I hope not.

He told me
he's absolutely certain

the Japs are gonna hit Midway

860
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:37,474

01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,539
whether or not
I can believe him.

862
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:42,005
Well, if you don't
believe him,

we'll all be
speaking Japanese.

Or, most likely,

01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:55,475
Exactly.

ROCHEFORT:
So, this is where it starts.

870
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:01,072
We intercept roughly 60%

871
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,640
of secure Japanese
radio traffic

872
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,273
and we've cracked
enough of their code

873
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:07,239
to be able to break about 40%
of those messages.

874
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:09,473
So, we're able to read
about a quarter

875
01:01:09,475 --> 01:01:11,339

876

Uh, no, not exactly.

for assembling the fragments.

He can recall a message
from two months ago,

883
01:01:27,675 --> 01:01:30,206
and plug it
into today's intercept.

with Washington.

to the same raw information,

that Japs are gonna attack
a major target codenamed AF.

that AF

is located
in the South Pacific,

And maybe I've never seen

we can break

I don't know
if I can do this, sir.

982

Your dad wanted you
to be an officer, huh?

987
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:28,414
Actually, my dad didn't have
much respect for officers.

988
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:30,612
Said that most of them
didn't know

989

their ass from their elbow.

990
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,280
You know, my dad was
a tough son of a bitch.

991
01:06:36,282 --> 01:06:38,513
You know
how I got his respect?

992

By always staying
in the fight.

993
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:42,747
I wish I had the luxury

994
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,747
of worrying
about your confidence,

995
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:46,148
but we're short on pilots,

996
01:06:47,182 --> 01:06:48,215

Tell me.

1003

What's your secret?

1004
01:07:11,415 --> 01:07:12,680
My secret?

1005

He wants to know
why nothing bothers you.

1006
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:19,082
My uncle was a welder
on the Empire State Building.

1007
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:20,581
He'd walk on a beam,

1008
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:23,448
1,000 feet up in the sky,
no ropes, nothing.

1009
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:25,414
And everyone thought
he was crazy,

1010
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,314
but to him,
he was just doing a job.

1011
01:07:27,316 --> 01:07:29,347
And one Sunday,
he's walking home from church.

1012
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,614
He's a block
away from his house,

1013
01:07:30,616 --> 01:07:33,481
when a cab
jumps over the curb,

1014
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:35,281
splatters him like a bug.

1015
01:07:35,283 --> 01:07:36,650
You never know
what's gonna get you.

1016

So, why worry about it?

Hey. Let's go.

1018

Simple scouting mission.

1019

On the way home, we'll
practice the dive, you got it?

1020
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:50,548
Yes, sir.

We'll be going deeper
this time,

up and decides

he could cut it.

just the usual jitters.

I take him under my wing.

Everybody knows
something big is coming.

against the whole
Japanese fleet.

1070

And if we lose,
they own the Pacific,

1071
01:11:37,788 --> 01:11:40,553
and they raid the West Coast.

it was just me and my plane...
